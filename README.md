# Series Metric Analyzer, a Lucene indexer for series information

Series Metric Analyzer is an app powered by Apache Lucene that allows you to build information indexes from a .csv of dialogs of your favourite series.

The program will perform a tokenization, hunspell and synonymy morphological analysis given the list of dialogues in the series in .csv format, as well as analyzing other possible metrics for indexing such as chapter scores, characters, locations, etc.

You can use indexes created with this app in [SeriesMetricSearcher](https://github.com/RedRiotTank/SeriesMetricSearcher) to visualize and check the index in user interface.
